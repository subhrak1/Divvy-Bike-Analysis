# Divvy-Bike-Analysis
The goal of this project is to attempt to predict how many Divvy bikes will be checked out at a
particular location/station in a given hour. If the number of bikes to be checked out can be known
beforehand, Divvy can ensure there are enough bikes installed for the customers. This is
important as it will improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Divvy has made their data open-sourced from 2013 available from their website for anyone to
use. The data is available in quarterly format in .csv files
